Just an educational example PHP module, with a test/build/release pipeline for PHP 7.4/8.0

* Similar to the example produced by [php-src ext_skel.php](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/master/ext/ext_skel.php)
* Patched to make it compatible with both PHP 7.x and 8.x versions
* Added a Github Actions for CI/CD
